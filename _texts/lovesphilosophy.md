- The Fountains mingle with the River
- {:.indent-1}And the Rivers with the Ocean,
- The winds of Heaven mix forever
- {:.indent-1}With a sweet emotion;
- Nothing in the world is single
- {:.indent-1}All things by a law divine
- In one spirit meet & mingle.
- {:.indent-1}Why not I with thine?—

- See the mountains kiss high Heaven
- {:.indent-1}And the waves clasp one another;
- No sister-flower would be forgiven
- {:.indent-1}If it disdained its brother,
- And the sunlight clasps the earth
- {:.indent-1}And the moonbeams kiss the sea
- What is all this sweet work worth
- {:.indent-1}If thou kiss not me?
