The Fountains mingle with the River
 And the Rivers with the Ocean,
The winds of Heaven mix forever
 With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single
 All things by a law divine
In one spirit meet & mingle.
 Why not I with thine?—

See the mountains kiss high Heaven
 And the waves clasp one another;
No sister-flower would be forgiven
 If it disdained its brother,
And the sunlight clasps the earth
 And the moonbeams kiss the sea
What is all this sweet work worth
 If thou kiss not me?
